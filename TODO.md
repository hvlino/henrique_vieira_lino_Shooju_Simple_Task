### Todo

- [ ] if your script is run more than once, it should only output data if the source has released new data since the last run
- [ ] output outliers/gaps in the data to a separate issues.txt file in whatever format you see fit
 

### Done âœ“

- [x] Uses only the URL provided as input (hard-coded)
- [x] Downloads, unzips, parses based on that single URL input
- [x] Writes to stdout a new line delimited (\n) JSON series-by-series representation of the input CSV
- [x] make the name of your py file meaningful to us, not to you
- [x] make sure your output has recent data (last few months)
